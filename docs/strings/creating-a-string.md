For creating a `string`, you can use `var` keyboard.

Example:
```
var name as string
```
or
```
var name = ""
```

Both examples create an empty `string`.

You can define the content of a `string` by using the `=` symbol.

Example:
```
var name = "cat"
```

That creates a variable with the name `name` and the content `"cat"`, which is going to be showed as cat`.
