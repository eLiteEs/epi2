# epi2
In this repo you can find the code of epi2 programming language.

You can help the development of this programming language or you can use it for making your own programming language.

## Build
You can build this project by running this command on Windows 10/11 of 64 bits cmd:

`buildn`

Powershell:

`.\buildn`

Or you can directly use `g++ src/epi.cpp -o target/epi2.exe -static...` but there are a lot of arguments for required libraries so that's likely a mess.
